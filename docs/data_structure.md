# Data Structure

There are two main sources for the geometry:

- The 3DBAG which provides outer shells for the buildings.
  These files are expected to be in CityJSON format.
- The custom geometry which contains buildings outer shells but also potentially building parts, storeys and rooms.
  These files are expected to be in glTF format.

Both sources are expected to have coordinates following EPSG:7415.
