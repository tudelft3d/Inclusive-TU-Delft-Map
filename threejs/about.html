                    <p class="lead"> The Inclusive 3D Campus Map began as a collaborative project by five Master’s
                        students in Geomatics from TU Delft during the elective course GEOIT1501. </p>

                    <p>Guided by project supervisors Gina Stavropoulou and Bastiaan van Loenen, and working together
                        with TU Delft Diversity & Inclusion Office, we formed a project’s aim: to develop a
                        comprehensive, accessible and truly inclusive map that serves the needs of every student, staff
                        member, and visitor at TU Delft.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Creating a detailed, inclusive map that covers the entire TU Delft campus is an
                        extensive effort requiring time. Due to these constraints, the map you see today is a work in
                        continuous development.</p>
                    <p class="lead">We began by mapping the interior of the Faculty of Architecture (BK) building as our
                        initial proof-of-concept. Our aim is to continuously add more interior data for all campus
                        buildings as time goes on, expanding the map's coverage building by building. Additionally, we
                        are committed to continuously improving our map through the valuable feedback we receive from
                        our users.</p>
